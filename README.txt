GITHUB Best Practices:

1. NEVER EVER COMMIT/PUBLISH TO THE MASTER BRANCH
2. Never commit/publish directly to Development
3. Before starting a task, create and checkout to a branch named after the task id (e.g. 'ACT-1')
4. After finishing a task, commit to the branch (always have a name and description of what you did)
5. After committing, publish/push the branch to GITHUB
6. Submit a pull request on the GITHUB website to merge your code to the Development branch
   (always check to make sure that the base branch is 'Development' not 'master')
7. Wait for a second party to merge your changes after submitting a pull request
   (never merge your own changes)
8. Get started on your next task!
